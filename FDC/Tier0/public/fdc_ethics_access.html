      <section>
        <h2>Commitment to Ethical Innovation</h2>
        <p>The Functional Drug Complex (FDC) platform is committed to ethical discovery, transparency, and equitable access across global health systems. This includes the intentional exclusion of exploitative licensing and AI-generated compounds with dual-use concerns.</p>

        <h2>Access Framework</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Tier 0: Public preview only - no experimental access.</li>
          <li>Tier 1: Requires NDA and basic review agreement.</li>
          <li>Tier 2: Reserved for vetted collaborators with published intent.</li>
          <li>Tier 3: Highest-level access - strictly governed by licensing board.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Review and Licensing Committee</h2>
        <p>A multidisciplinary ethics board will oversee access requests and licensing eligibility. This includes scientific advisors, legal experts, bioethics professionals, and KT governance.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>AI Oversight</h2>
        <p>All AI-generated compounds are audited using the Moleculogic-SEI stack. No logic or molecule may proceed to Tier 3 deployment without clearance from SEI reflexive simulation and ethical filters.</p>
