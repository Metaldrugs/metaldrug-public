      <h1>FDC Platform - Use Case Briefs</h1>
      <p>This document provides illustrative Tier 1-level briefs showcasing the functional advantages and applications of the FDC platform.</p>

      <h2>1. Functional Nanocarriers for CNS Disorders</h2>
      <p>Design of peptide-coordinated delivery complexes capable of traversing the blood-brain barrier with high entropy tolerance and metabolic survivability.</p>

      <h2>2. Multi-Target Autoimmune Regulation</h2>
      <p>Construction of FDC compounds that dynamically adjust immunosuppressive payload release in response to local ROS concentration and pH gradients.</p>

      <h2>3. Tunable Anti-Cancer Scaffolds</h2>
      <p>FDCs synthesized to morphologically adapt between solid tumor and leukemia environments, modifying target affinities via SEI-Lite feedback.</p>

      <h2>4. Vaccine Amplification Additives</h2>
      <p>Integration of FDCs as adjuvant enhancers that boost T-cell activation in mRNA and protein vaccine platforms with minimal toxicity.</p>

      <p>Access to mechanistic simulations, formulation parameters, and SEI logic for each use case is available under <a href="request-tier2.html">Tier 2 access</a>.</p>
